## Hi there 👋

It's hard to define what `AKASS Organization` is. We just wanna do splendid works, but everything starts from tinny things, let's encourage mutually.

Now we are providing some common services like img host, file mirrors and file hosts to those who need them.

We want do more than this.

## The Founder say

I'm Akatsukiro, the founder of Also Know As Splendid Services, or AKASS.

This is the organization where I can contribute with my friends. Love it. 💖

As for now, I'm just a noob, and I hope AKASS could record my steps to success. Maybe one day many years later, I can achieve myself.
